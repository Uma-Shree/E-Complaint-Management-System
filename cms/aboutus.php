        <h3><strong>It is a Digital Portal where any user can register online complaint.
         A Grievance is that the dispute that arises at any level of organization.
         <br><br> In Logistics organization, a worker 's community is the most vulnerable entity. In many circumstances worker fail to state their issues and sometimes fail to seek out proper
            support for the issue they are facing in an organization. On analyzing the above mentioned problems we designed Student Grievance support system to deal with the grievance and to seek the redressal. The web application builds a platform for
            the Employee to lodge the arising conflicts in their daily walk of lives. In the web application worker can address their complaints which are forwarded to the Grievance Redressal Committee. The Committee will forward the valid complaints
            to the Staff or Department supporting the sensitivity of the matter. The Department will take action and update the status which can be viewed by the workers. This project provides transparency to the employee which can be incorporated to
            supply solutions to the worker.<strong>
